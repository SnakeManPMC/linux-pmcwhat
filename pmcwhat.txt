we are referring the DayDream dir as the default "/home/bbs" and temp dir
to "/tmp/dd" in this document.

1) copy pmcwhat and pmcwhat.cfg files to /home/bbs/doors and give the
   permissions "chown bbs.users *" in the same dir, just in case.

2) add pmcwhat to your daydream.cfg file like this:

	DOOR_COMMAND.. PMCWHAT
        DOOR_TYPE..... 1
	DOOR_SECURITY. 10
	DOOR_EXECUTE.. /home/bbs/doors/pmcwhat %N
	DOOR_CONFS1... XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
	DOOR_CONFS2... XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

   remember to run "/home/bbs/utils/ddcfg /home/bbs/daydream.cfg" after 
   the edition of configuration file. 

3) login to daydream and type "pmcwhat" at main prompt.


after you're tested and got the baby running, you can change the colours
from the pmcwhat.cfg file to suit your bbs colour scheme.
also you can find some more detailed information from our web pages.
